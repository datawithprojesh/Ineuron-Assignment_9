    "#### In Python, a lambda function is a small anonymous function that can be defined without a name. It is created using the lambda keyword and is typically used for simple, one-line operations. Lambda functions are also known as anonymous functions because they don't require a formal name declaration like regular functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Complexity: Lambda functions are typically used for simple, concise operations that can be expressed in a single line of code. Regular functions can have multiple lines of code, allowing for more complex logic and operations.\n",

    "    \n",
    "#### Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced Reusability: Due to their anonymous nature, lambda functions cannot be reused or called from multiple locations within your code. If you need to use the same logic repeatedly, it's more appropriate to define a regular named function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of Complex Control Flow: Lambda functions cannot include complex control flow structures like loops or conditional statements. They are limited to simple expressions, which can restrict their usefulness for more intricate operations."
